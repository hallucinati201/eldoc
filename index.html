According to his wife, the patient complained of a headache. He was cursing at the football game on television when he started to stutter, make guttural noises, and then seemingly stared blankly and did not respond to her. She noticed that his right arm was shaking rhythmically. Maybe 5 minutes later, the shaking stopped and the patient started to make semipurposeful movements (reaching for objects with his left hand) but still appeared 'dazed.' He takes no blood thinners, and his prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR) is normal. His serum glucose is 130, his platelets are 220 (normal), and his blood BP is 160/89 currently (with similar readings obtained by EMS in the field). The initial head CT scan is unremarkable. During your interview in the ED, you observe the patient halt purposeful movements and stare blankly, and you witness subtle shaking of the right arm for about 20 seconds. His nurse tells you that he has seemed 'spaced out' and sleepy during his brief period in the ED. The next most appropriate step is:",

The patient received a total of 8 mg of lorazepam IV in the ED and was loaded with fosphenytoin at 20 mg/kg IV (at 150 mg/minute). Owing to continued brief seizure activity, a subsequent dose of fosphenytoin 10 mg/kg was administered; this fosphenytoin finished infusing about 3 minutes ago.

She underwent gastric bypass surgery 10 years ago and has not been compliant with diet instructions since then. Her examination shows sensory loss to vibration and proprioception in a stocking-glove distribution with hyperreflexia in her bilateral upper extremities and patella (with crossed adductors). Her ankle jerks are absent. Strength examination shows mild weakness in bilateral dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, toe flexion, and toe extension. Gait has both steppage and some spasticity observed. Cerebellar examination is normal. Some of her laboratory studies are pending. However, her hemoglobin is slightly low at 10.4 grams/deciliter with an MCV of 118. Her methylmalonic acid is quite elevated at 1000. MRI of the cervical spine shows non-enhancing hyperintensities in the posterior and lateral spinal cord.
